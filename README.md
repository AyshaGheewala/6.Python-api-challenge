Module 6 Challenge - What is the weather like as we approach the equator?

This Challenge contains two deliverables; WeatherPy and VacationPy.

WeatherPy:
- I created a representative model of weather for over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. 
- I generated a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
    Latitude vs. Temperature
    Latitude vs. Humidity
    Latitude vs. Cloudiness
    Latitude vs. Wind Speed
- I computed the linear regression for each relationship.

VacationPy:
- I used the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of specific coordinates.
- Using the geoViews Python library, I created maps to display data for different cities.
